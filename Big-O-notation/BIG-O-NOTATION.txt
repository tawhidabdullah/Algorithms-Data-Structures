we use big o notation to rate our code , we already know that we many to ways to solve one problem in code ,
how we will know which way is the best, here's where comes the big o notation.

==>> which give us precise  vocabulary to talk about how our code performs 
=>> It is usefull for discussing trade-offs between diffrents approaches 

BIG O NOTATION allows us to formally talk about how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the input grows.
